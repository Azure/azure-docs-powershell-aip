examples:
- title: 'Example 1: (Unified labeling client only) Get tracking data for a specific document, using its contentId'
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Get-AipServiceDocumentLog -ContentId c03bf90c-6e40-4f3f-9ba0-2bcd77524b87
  description: |-
    This command runs a query to return tracking information for a specific document, with a contentID value of **c03bf90c-6e40-4f3f-9ba0-2bcd77524b87**
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 2: (Classic client only) Get all tracking information for a user'
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Get-AipServiceTrackingLog -UserEmail "test@contoso.com"
  description: |-
    This command generates a log of all the tracking information for documents that were protected by or accessed by the user with the email address "test@contoso.com".
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 3: (Classic client only) Get tracking information for a user, for a specific time period'
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Get-AipServiceTrackingLog -UserEmail "test@contoso.com" -FromTime "01/01/2018 00:00:00" -ToTime "01/31/2018 23:59:59"
  description: |-
    This command is the same as the previous example except that the results are limited to documents that were tracked within a specific time period by using the *FromTime* and *ToTime* parameters. In this example, the time period is all days in January 2018, using the US date format.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 4: (Classic client only) Get all tracking information for a user and save the results to a .csv file'
  code: |-
    PS C:\>$trackingLogs = Get-AipServiceTrackingLog -UserEmail "test@contoso.com"
    PS C:\>$trackingLogs | Export-Csv 'C:\Temp\TrackingLog.csv' -NoTypeInformation
  description: |-
    The first command generates a log of all the tracking information for documents that were protected by or accessed by the user with the email address "test@contoso.com", and saves the result in a variable.

    The second command then uses the [Export-Csv](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/export-csv?view=powershell-4.0) cmdlet to convert the tracking information into .csv format, and saves it to the C:\Temp\TrackingLog.csv file.

  The **Get-AipServiceTrackingLog** cmdlet runs a query to return protection information about tracked documents.

  Information returned includes:

  - The document content ID, with the document name if available.
  - The Rights Management issuer.
  - The users who accessed the document, when, and from what location. 
  - What protection template ID or specific usage rights were used to protect the document and whether access was granted or denied.

  You can specify a start time and stop time of entries to include. The output is returned as a list of PowerShell objects in the PowerShell console.

  **Unified labeling client**

  The **Get-AipServiceTracking** cmdlet returns tracking information about a protected document with a specified contentID. 

  To retrieve the contentID for a specific document, use the [Get-AipServiceDocumentLog](Get-AipServiceDocumentLog.yml) cmdlet.

  **Classic client**

  The **Get-AipServiceTrackingLog** cmdlet returns tracking information about protected documents for a specified user who protected documents (the Rights Management issuer) or who accessed protected documents. This cmdlet helps to answer the question "Which protected documents did a specified user track or access?" 

  You can alternatively use the document tracking site to get the protection information about the tracked documents. For more information, see the [Tracking and revoking documents for users](/information-protection/rms-client/client-admin-guide-document-tracking#tracking-and-revoking-documents-for-users) section in the admin guide.
