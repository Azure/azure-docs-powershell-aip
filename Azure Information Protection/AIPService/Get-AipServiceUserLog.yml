  code: |-
    PS C:\>Get-AipServiceUserLog -Path 'C:\Logs' -FromDate 12/12/2015 -ToDate 12/15/2015 -NumberOfThreads 10
  description: |-
    This command downloads user logs created between 12/12/2015 and 12/15/2015 (in UTC time) to the folder C:\Logs. 

    The command uses 10 threads to download the logs.

    PS C:\>Get-AipServiceUserLog -Path 'C:\Logs' -ForDate 12/5/2015
  description: |-
    This command downloads the user logs for 12/5/2015 (in UTC time) to the folder C:\Logs.

- title: 'Example 3: Get user logs for a date, taking into account a UTC +offset time conversion'
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Get-AipServiceUserLog -Path 'C:\Logs' -ForDate 2/2/2016 12:00:00
  description: |-
    This command shows how you might need to take into account a UTC +offset time conversion from your local time, before downloading user logs to the folder C:\Logs.

    You are in New Zealand, which means your computer's local time is UTC+12 and you want to download logs for 2/2/2016 for your local time rather than UTC. If you didn't specify the time of 12:00:00 with the date, your logs would contain data for only the first 12 hours of 2/2/2016 (and the last 12 hours of the previous day).

  code: |-
    PS C:\>Get-AipServiceUserLog -Path 'C:\Logs' -FromDate 2/1/2016 18:00:00 -ToDate 2/9/15/2016 18:00:00

    This command shows how you might need to take into account a UTC -offset time conversion from your local time before downloading user logs to the folder C:\Logs.

    You are in Houston, USA, which means your computer's local time is UTC-6 and you want to download logs from 2/2/2016 through 2/9/2016 for your local time rather than UTC. 

    If you didn't specify the previous date and time of 18:00:00, your logs would be missing data for the first 6 hours of 2/2/2016 your local time (and an additional 6 hours for the ending date).

parameters:

- type: <xref href="DateTime" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: FromDate
  description: |+
    Specifies the start date (and optionally, a time) for the log file as a **DateTime** object.

    Use this parameter when you do not use the *ForDate* parameter.

    If you specify this parameter but not the *ToDate*, the end date is the day you run the command.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: NumberOfThreads
  description: |+
    Specifies the number of threads to use to download logs.

    The acceptable values for this parameter are: 1-32. 

    The default value is 3.

description: |-
  The **Get-AipServiceUserLog** cmdlet downloads protection user logs to local storage. You must specify either a specific date or a date range to download the log entries.

  You must use PowerShell to get these user logs; you cannot do this action by using a management portal.

  When you run this command and specify a date only for the **DateTime** objects, the time is assumed to be 00:00:00 in your local time, and then converted to UTC. 

  When you specify a time with a date (for example, **-ForDate "2/1/2016 15:00:00"**), that date and time is converted to UTC. The **Get-AipServiceUserLog** command then gets the logs for that UTC time period. Usage logs are only available when the “date” field name contains a value of a previous date (in UTC time). Usage logs from the current date are not available.

  See the examples for how you might need to change your **DateTime** values, to accommodate the conversion needed for your local time.

  For more information about protection usage logging and a step-by-step example, see [Logging and analyzing protection usage from Azure In formation Protection](/information-protection/deploy-use/log-analyze-usage).
