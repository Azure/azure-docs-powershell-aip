    You can specify a group that contains individual users, or nested groups. The email address must be a valid group email address that already exists in the organization.

  The **Set-AipServiceDoNotTrackUserGroup** cmdlet sets a group for Azure Information Protection when you use document tracking and you have users who must not be tracked. This configuration might be needed for privacy requirements. For more information, see [Privacy controls for your document tracking site](/information-protection/rms-client/client-admin-guide-document-tracking#privacy-controls-for-your-document-tracking-site).

  If this cmdlet has been run before, running it again overwrites the group that was set previously. You can set only one group, but it can contain nested groups.

  You must use PowerShell to set this group so that users are not tracked; you cannot do this configuration by using a management portal.
