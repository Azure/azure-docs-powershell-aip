  The **Disable-AipServiceDocumentTrackingFeature** cmdlet turns off the document tracking feature for Azure Information Protection, so that users in your organization cannot track or revoke access to documents that they have protected.

  Document tracking is turned on by default, but you may need to turn it off for privacy requirements in your organization or region. This setting is organization-wide, and you cannot turn it off for some users in your organization but not others.

  To turn off document tracking features with the unified labeling client, make sure that you set the **EnableTrackAndRevoke** advanced client setting to **False** in addition to running this cmdlet.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you have upgraded to the unified labeling client from the classic client, and have had document tracking turned off, it remains turned off after your upgrade.
