  The **Enable-AipService** cmdlet activates the protection service from Azure Information Protection so that all users in your tenant can protect documents and emails. 

  You can also do this action in a management portal. For more information, see [Activating the protection service from Azure Information Protection](/information-protection/deploy-use/activate-service). 

  When you activate the protection service, you turn on this service for all rights-enabled applications and services for your tenant, but some applications and services and might need further configuration before they can use the protection capabilities from Azure Information Protection.

  For information about other deployment steps that might be needed, see the [deployment roadmap](/information-protection/plan-design/deployment-roadmap).
