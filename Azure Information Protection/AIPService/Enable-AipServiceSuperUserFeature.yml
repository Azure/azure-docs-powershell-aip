  The **Enable-AipServiceSuperUserFeature** cmdlet enables the super user feature for your tenant's protection service from Azure Information Protection. When this feature is enabled, any users that are defined as super users for your organization (individually or by the super user group) can decrypt content that your tenant protected, and can remove protection from this content, even if an expiration date has been set and expired. Typically, this level of access is required for legal eDiscovery and by auditing teams. 

  You must use PowerShell to configure super users; you cannot do this configuration by using a management portal.

  By default, the super user feature is not enabled, and no users are assigned to this feature. To assign users, you must use [Add-AipServiceSuperUser](./Add-AipServiceSuperUser.yml) or [Set-AipServiceSuperUserGroup](./Set-AipServiceSuperUserGroup.yml).

  > [!CAUTION]
  > We recommend that you enable the super user feature on an as-needed basis. During standard operations, we recommend that you disable the super user feature, unless you use it to provide a trusted application with the ability to decrypt rights-protected content. 
  >
  > For example, this exception might be needed for an application to scan the contents of a file for malware.
