  The **Get-AipServiceOnboardingControlPolicy** cmdlet obtains your Azure Information Protection user on-boarding control policy to support a gradual deployment by controlling which users in your organization can protect content by using Azure Information Protection.

  You must use PowerShell to view this configuration; you cannot view this configuration by using a management portal.

  This control can be based on assigned user licenses for the Azure Rights Management service or membership in a designated security group. You can also define whether the policy applies to just mobile devices, just Windows clients, or mobile devices and Windows clients. For more information, see [Set-AipServiceOnboardingControlPolicy](./Set-AipServiceOnboardingControlPolicy.yml).
