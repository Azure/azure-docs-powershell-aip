  The **Enable-AipServiceDocumentTrackingFeature** cmdlet turns on the document track and revoke features for Azure Information Protection.

  Activity related to shared documents (who opened them, when, from which location) is shown for only when the document track and revoke features are turned on. 


  - This setting is organization-wide; you cannot turn on document tracking for some users in your organization and not for others.

  - You must use PowerShell to turn on document tracking; you cannot do this configuration by using a management portal.

  - By default, document tracking is turned on, so you would run this cmdlet only if somebody had previously turned off document tracking for your tenant.

  - [User Guide: Revoke document access with Azure Information Protection](/information-protection/rms-client/revoke-access-user) 

  **Classic client only**:

  If you are using the classic client, document tracking provides uses with access to the document tracking site, where they can view the protected documents that they have shared to date.

  For more information, see:
  [Configuring and using document tracking for Azure Information Protection for the classic client](/information-protection/rms-client/client-admin-guide-document-tracking).
