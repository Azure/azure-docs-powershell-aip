  The **Get-AIPServiceDocumentLog** cmdlet runs a query to return protection information about tracked documents.

  Information returned includes:
  - The document content ID, with the document name if available.
  - The Rights Management owner and Rights Management issuer.
  - The users and groups that were granted access.
  - The protection template ID or specific usage rights that protect the document.
  - Any expiry, offline access, or revocation setting.

  You can specify a start time and stop time of entries to include. The output is returned as a list of PowerShell objects in the PowerShell console.

  For more information, see [Rights Management owners and IRights Management issuers](/information-protection/deploy-use/configure-usage-rights#rights-management-issuer-and-rights-management-owner).

  When used with the unified labeling client, the query is based on the document name, the owner email, or both.

  You must specify at least one of the following parameters:

  - **ContentName**
  - **Owner**

  > [!TIP]
  > If you use the **ContentName** parameter, we recommend that you also use the **FromTime** and **ToTime** parameters to filter your content to a specific time period.
