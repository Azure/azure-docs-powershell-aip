description: |-
  The **Clear-RMSAuthentication** cmdlet clears the credentials that are used when a user has previously entered their user name and password to authenticate to Azure Rights Management (Azure RMS).

  When you enter a user name and password to sign in to Azure RMS, the credentials are cached on the computer. Because these cached credentials are used across PowerShell sessions, to sign in as a different user, you must first run **Clear-RMSAuthentication**. You are then prompted for new credentials.

  This cmdlet applies to Azure RMS only and when you authenticate as a user rather than a service principal. It does not apply to AD RMS.

  > [!TIP]
  > If you want to clear the credentials for a service principal that you specified with [Set-RMSServerAuthentication](./Set-RMSServerAuthentication.yml), close your PowerShell session and start a new session that runs **Set-RMSServerAuthentication** with the new credentials.
