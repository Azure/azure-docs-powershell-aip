examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Update the scanner after the Azure Information Protection classic client has been upgraded, and set a scanner cluster  name'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Update-AIPScanner -cluster USWEST
  description: |-
    This command updates the database schema for the Azure Information Protection scanner, and sets the cluster name to **USWEST** rather than use the default name of the computer. 

    You are prompted to continue and if you confirm, the scanner then gets is configuration from the **USWEST** scanner cluster that you configure by using the Azure portal.

    The Azure Information Protection scanner is updated successfully, the scanner database is renamed to **AIPScanner_USWEST**, and the scanner now gets its configuration from the Azure Information Protection service. 

    For reference purposes, a backup of your old configuration is stored in **%localappdata%\Microsoft\MSIP\ScannerConfiguration.bak**.

  name: Cluster

    **Relevant for:** Unified labeling client only.

    Specifies the configured name of the scanner's database, used to identify the scanner you want to update.

    Use the following syntax: **AIPScannerUL_<cluster_name>**. 

    Using either this parameter or the **Profile** parameter is mandatory. Starting in version 2.7.0.0 of the unified labeling client, we recommend using this parameter instead of the **Profile** parameter.

  name: Force
  description: |+
    Forces the command to run without asking for user confirmation.

    When used, the command first verifies that all nodes under the same cluster are offline. If any nodes are found to be online, a warning is displayed with the node details.

        The database name for the scanner is **AIPScannerUL_\<profile_name>**. 

    - **Classic client:** This parameter is optional. 

        - If it's not specified, the default database is used, which is **AIPScanner_\<computer_name>**. 

        - When you specify a profile name with this parameter, the database name for the scanner has the following syntax: **AIPScanner_\<profile_name>**.
