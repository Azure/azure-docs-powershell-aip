description: |-
  The **Import-MIPNetworkDiscoveryConfiguration** cmdlet imports local configuration settings for the Azure Information Protection network scan jobs, and automatically configures the scanner to use the offline configuration. 

  Network Discovery network scan jobs enable Azure Information Protection administrators to scan specific IP addresses or ranges for risky repositories to add to scan further with content scan jobs.

  - Use this cmdlet only after you have configured a cluster and a network scan job in the Azure portal, and exported those settings to a file. 

  - If you need to make configuration changes to the network scan jobs after you have run this cmdlet, make those changes in the Azure portal, export the network scan job again, and rerun this cmdlet.

  If you want to change the scanner to use the online configuration directly after you have run this cmdlet, use the [Set-MIPNetworkDiscoveryConfiguration](./Set-MIPNetworkDiscoveryConfiguration.yml) and set the *OnlineConfiguration* parameter to **On**.

  Any changes will be used the next time the scanner runs. If you need the changes to take effect immediately, restart the Azure Information Protection Scanner service on the Windows server computer.
