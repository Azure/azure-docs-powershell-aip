  description: |-
    This command sets a label named "General" on all files in the **Projects** folder and any of its subfolders.

    If the General label is configured to apply encryption, the files that were successfully labeled with this command will also be encrypted. In this case, the Rights Management owner (who has the Rights Management Full Control permission) of these files is the user who ran the PowerShell command.

    In this example, one file was not labeled (skipped) because it required justification. This might be the intended outcome to ensure that a file with a higher classification label or protection isn't accidentally overwritten with a lower classification label or has protection removed. 

    To enable this safeguard, the Office 365 classification label policy must be configured to require justification for removing a label or lowering the classification. When you then run this command without the **JustificationMessage** parameter and the label triggers justification, the file is skipped with the comment "No label to apply".

  name: CustomPermissions
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the variable name that stores an ad-hoc protection policy, which was created by using the [New-AIPCustomPermissions](./New-AIPCustomPermissions.yml) cmdlet. The ad-hoc protection policy is used to protect the file or files with custom permissions.

  name: EnableTracking
  description: |+
    Specify this parameter to register a protected document with the document tracking portal. 

    The user running this cmdlet and global administrators can then track the protected document and if necessary, revoke it. For more information about the document tracking site, see [Configuring and using document tracking for Azure Information Protection](/azure/information-protection/rms-client/client-admin-guide-document-tracking) from the admin guide. 

    If the label does not apply protection, this parameter is ignored.

  name: JustificationMessage
  description: |+
    The justification reason for lowering the classification label, removing a label, or removing protection, if the Azure Information Protection policy requires users to supply this information. If setting a label triggers the justification and this reason is not supplied, the label is not applied. In this case, the status returned is "Skipped" with the comment "Justification required".

    To find the label ID:

    The label ID value is not displayed in the Microsoft 365 Compliance center. However, you can use the following Office 365 Security & Compliance Center PowerShell command to find this value: `Get-Label | Format-Table -Property DisplayName, Name, Guid`

    For files that have labels applied, you can also run the [Get-AIPFileStatus](./Get-AIPFileStatus.yml) cmdlet to identify the label ID (MainLabelId or SubLabelId).

    **Relevant for:** Unified labeling client only

    Removes protection from a file. If the file is labeled, the label is not removed.

    You must have sufficient usage rights or be a super user for your organization to remove protection from files. For more information, see [Configuring super users for Azure Rights Management and discovery services or data recovery](/azure/information-protection/configure-super-users).

    Use the **Set-AIPFileLabel** PowerShell cmdlet to enable removal of protection from container files (**zip**, **.rar**, **.7z**, and **.pst**).

    > [!NOTE]
    > - This remove protection capability is disabled by default and must first be enabled using the [Set-LabelPolicy](/azure/information-protection/rms-client/clientv2-admin-guide-customizations#enable-removal-of-protection-from-compressed-files) cmdlet.
    >
    > - For .pst files, 5 GB is the maximum file size supported with this cmdlet.

  For the AIP unified labeling client, the **Set-AIPFileLabel** cmdlet sets or removes a sensitivity label for one or more files. This action can automatically apply protection when labels are configured to apply encryption. 

  Additionally, you can use this cmdlet to apply custom permissions when they are created as an ad-hoc protection policy object with the [New-AIPCustomPermissions](New-AIPCustomPermissions.yml) cmdlet. 

  When the command runs successfully, any existing label or protection can be replaced.

  You can run this cmdlet non-interactively. For more information, see the [Unified labeling client admin guide](/information-protection/rms-client/clientv2-admin-guide-powershell#how-to-label-files-non-interactively-for-azure-information-protection).

  > [!NOTE]
  > When running the **Set-AIPFileLabel** cmdlet in a loop, add these two lines after the cmdlet:
  > **[GC]::Collect()**    
  **[GC]::WaitForPendingFinalizers()**
