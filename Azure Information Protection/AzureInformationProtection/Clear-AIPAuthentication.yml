  The Clear-AIPAuthentication cmdlet resets the user settings for the Azure Rights Management service. 

  - **For the unified labeling client**, files in **%LocalAppData%\Microsoft\MSIP\AppDetails** are not deleted if you authenticate by using a token from Azure AD when you run Set-AIPAuthentication.

  - **For both clients**, all Rights Management templates from the **%LocalAppData%\Microsoft\MSIPC\msip** folder are deleted for the current user. 

  - Rights Management templates are not deleted from the **%LocalAppData\Microsoft\MSIPC** folder that Office uses.

  For a list of files and registry entries that are deleted, see the the details about the **Reset Settings** option in the following admin guides:

  - **[Unified labeling client](/information-protection/rms-client/clientv2-admin-guide#more-information-about-the-reset-settings-option)**

  - **[Classic client](/information-protection/rms-client/client-admin-guide#more-information-about-the-reset-settings-option)**

  > [!NOTE]
  > To provide a unified and streamlined customer experience, the **Azure Information Protection classic client** and **Label Management** in the Azure Portal are being **deprecated** as of **March 31, 2021**. 
  > 
  > This time-frame allows all current Azure Information Protection customers to transition to our unified labeling solution using the Microsoft Information Protection Unified Labeling platform. Learn more in the official [deprecation notice](https://aka.ms/aipclassicsunset).
