# Update-AIPScanner

## SYNOPSIS
Updates the database schema for the Azure Information Protection scanner.

**Relevant for:** AIP unified labeling and classic clients

## SYNTAX

```
Update-AIPScanner [-Profile | -Cluster <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Update-AIPScanner** cmdlet updates the database schema for the Azure Information Protection scanner and if required, the scanner service account is also granted delete permissions for the scanner database. 

Run this cmdlet after upgrading your Azure Information Protection client.

**Unified labeling client support**
   
The current version of the unified labeling client includes a preview version of the scanner that you can install for testing. 

For more information, see [Installing the Azure Information Protection scanner](/azure/information-protection/rms-client/clientv2-admin-guide#installing-the-azure-information-protection-scanner.md) from the admin guide for the unified labeling client.
    
Run this cmdlet with an account that has the database-level role of db_owner for the configuration database that the scanner is using, named AIPScannerUL_\<cluster_name(profile_name)>.

**Classic client support**

For more information about upgrading the scanner for the Azure Information Protection classic client, see [Upgrading the Azure Information Protection scanner](/azure/information-protection/rms-client/client-admin-guide#upgrading-the-azure-information-protection-scanner) from the admin guide.
    
Run this cmdlet with an account that has the database-level role of db_owner for the configuration database that the scanner is using:

- **For version 1.41.51.0:** This database is named **AzInfoProtectionScanner.**
- **For version 1.48.204.0:** This database is named **AIPScanner_\<cluster_name (profile_name)>.**
    
If you are upgrading from versions before 1.48.204.0, after the upgrade, the scanner changes how it gets its configuration settings. Instead of using PowerShell to configure the scanner locally, the scanner is now configured from the Azure Information Protection service, by using the Azure portal.

> [!NOTE]
> To provide a unified and streamlined customer experience, the **Azure Information Protection classic client** and **Label Management** in the Azure Portal are being **deprecated** as of **March 31, 2021.** 
> 
> This time-frame allows all current Azure Information Protection customers to transition to our unified labeling solution using the Microsoft Information Protection Unified Labeling platform. Learn more in the official [deprecation notice](https://aka.ms/aipclassicsunset).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Update the scanner after the Azure Information Protection classic client has been upgraded, and set a scanner cluster (profile) name
```
PS C:\> Update-AIPScanner â€“profile USWEST
```

This command updates the database schema for the Azure Information Protection scanner, and sets the cluster (profile) name to USWEST rather than use the default name of the computer. You are prompted to continue and if you confirm, the scanner then gets is configuration from the USWEST scanner cluster (profile) that you configure by using the Azure portal.

The Azure Information Protection scanner is updated successfully, the scanner database is renamed to AIPScanner_USWEST, and the scanner now gets its configuration from the Azure Information Protection service. 

For reference purposes, a backup of your old configuration is stored in %localappdata%\Microsoft\MSIP\ScannerConfiguration.bak. 


## PARAMETERS

### -Profile 
Note: This parameter is required for the scanner from the unified labeling client. From version 2.7.0.0, we recommend using Cluster switch instead of Profile switch.

Specifies the scanner profile name that contains the scanner configuration from the Azure Information Protection service. The scanner configuration database is updated to reflect the profile name that you specify. If you do not specify this parameter for the Azure Information Protection classic client, the computer name is used as the profile name. 

```yaml 
Type: String 
Parameter Sets: (All) 
Aliases: 
Required: False 
Position: Named 
Default value: None 
Accept pipeline input: False 
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
### -Cluster

> [!NOTE]
>  This parameter is required for the scanner from the unified labeling client. From version 2.7.0.0, we recommend using Cluster switch instead of Profile switch.

Specifies the scanner cluster (profile) name that contains the scanner configuration of the Azure Information Protection service. The scanner configuration database is updated to reflect the cluster (profile) name that you specify. 

If you do not specify this parameter for the Azure Information Protection classic client, the computer name is used as the cluster (profile) name.

```yaml 
Type: String 
Parameter Sets: (All) 
Position: Named 
Default value: None 
Accept pipeline input: False 
Accept wildcard characters: False 
```

### CommonParameters
This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable.
