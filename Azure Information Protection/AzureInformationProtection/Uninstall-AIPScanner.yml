  The **Uninstall-AIPScanner** cmdlet uninstalls the Azure Information Protection Scanner Windows Server service. 

  To run this command, you must have local Administrator rights for the Windows Server computer and you must restart the computer after running the command to complete the removal process.

  This command does *not* remove the following:

  - **Scanner reports**, located in **%localappdata%\Microsoft\MSIP\Scanner\Reports**.

  - **The SQL Server database** that was created by running the [Install-AIPScanner](./Install-AIPScanner.yml) cmdlet when the Azure Information Protection scanner was installed. If this database is no longer required, you must manually remove it. 

      This database is named as follows:

      |Client  |Instructions  |
      |---------|---------|
      |**Unified labeling client**     |  For the AIP unified labeling client, the database name for the scanner is **AIPScannerUL_\<cluster_name>**.       |
      |**Classic client**     |  For the AIP classic client, the default database name for the scanner is **AIPScanner_\<computer_name>** but when you specify a profile name, the database name for the scanner changes to **AIPScanner_\<profile_name)>**.       |
      | | |


  > [!NOTE]
  > To provide a unified and streamlined customer experience, the **Azure Information Protection classic client** and **Label Management** in the Azure Portal are being **deprecated** as of **March 31, 2021**. 
  > 
  > This time-frame allows all current Azure Information Protection customers to transition to our unified labeling solution using the Microsoft Information Protection Unified Labeling platform. Learn more in the official [deprecation notice](https://aka.ms/aipclassicsunset).
