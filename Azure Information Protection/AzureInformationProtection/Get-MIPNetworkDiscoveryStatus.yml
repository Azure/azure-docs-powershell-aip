  The **Get-MIPNetworkDiscoveryStatus** cmdlet returns the current status of the Network Discovery service.

  Network Discovery network scan jobs enable Azure Information Protection administrators to scan specific IP addresses or ranges for risky repositories to add to scan further with content scan jobs.

  Possible statuses include:

  - **Offline:** The service is not started.
  - **Idle:** The service is running but not currently scanning. 
  - **Scanning:** The service is running and currently scanning the network.
  - **Error:** The service is running but it has encountered an error that prevents it from scanning files. For example, the service cannot access the database for the scanner configuration.
