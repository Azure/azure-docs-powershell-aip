  [!INCLUDE [AADRM is deprecated](../includes/aadrm-deprecated.md)]

  The **Convert-AadrmKeyToKeyVault** cmdlet is only for customers who have previously created a customer-managed key for the Azure Rights Management service and have received an invitation from Microsoft to migrate their Azure Rights Management tenant key to Azure Key Vault.

  Important: Do not run this cmdlet if you have not received this invitation from Microsoft and do not run this cmdlet without assistance from Microsoft.

  You must use PowerShell to configure your tenant key; you cannot do this configuration by using a management portal.

  Azure RMS now uses Azure Key Vault to manage and monitor a customer-managed Azure RMS tenant key. To create a customer-managed Azure RMS tenant key for the first time, run [Use-AadrmKeyVaultKey](./Use-AadrmKeyVaultKey.yml) instead of this cmdlet.

  For more information about how to manage your Azure RMS tenant key, see [Planning and implementing your Azure Information Protection tenant key](/information-protection/plan-design/plan-implement-tenant-key).

  Before you run this cmdlet, you will need to identify your original customer-managed Azure RMS tenant key. To do that, use the [Get-AadrmKeys](./Get-AadrmKeys.yml) cmdlet. From the output and identified key, you will need the KeyIdentifier value for the *KeyIdentifier* parameter when you run this cmdlet.

  Also, your organization's administrator for Azure Key Vault must create a new key for Azure RMS and supply you with a URL for this key. You will need to specify the URL for the *KeyVaultKeyUrl* parameter when you run this cmdlet. This Azure Key Vault administrator must also grant Azure RMS access to the key vault that contains the key.

  For security reasons, this cmdlet does not let you change the access control for the key; this must be done from Key Vault.
