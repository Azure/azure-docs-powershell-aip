  The Get-AadrmDoNotTrackUserGroup cmdlet gets the email address of the currently configured group for the users who must not be tracked by the Azure Rights Management document tracking feature. 

  This configuration might be needed for privacy requirements. For more information, see [Privacy controls for your document tracking site](/information-protection/rms-client/client-admin-guide-document-tracking#privacy-controls-for-your-document-tracking-site).

  You must use PowerShell to retrieve this information; you cannot see it by using a management portal.
