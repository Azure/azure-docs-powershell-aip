# New-CustomPermissions

## SYNOPSIS

Creates an ad-hoc protection policy for custom permissions.

## SYNTAX

```
New-CustomPermissions -Users <String[]> -Permissions <Permissions> [-ExpirationDate <DateTime>]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **New-CustomPermissions** cmdlet creates an ad-hoc protection policy object for custom permissions that you store as a variable and then use to protect a file or files when you run the labeling cmdlet, [Set-FileLabel](./Set-FileLabel.md). 

If the label that is applied is configured for protection settings, the custom permissions from the ad-hoc protection policy replace the protection settings from the label.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1 - Create an ad-hoc protection policy object for a single user
```
PS C:\> $permissions = New-CustomPermissions -Users user1@contoso.com -Permissions Viewer
```

This command creates an ad-hoc protection policy object that grants **user1** from **contoso.com** usage rights from the Reviewer permissions and stores this policy in a variable named permissions. This ad-hoc protection policy can then be used to apply protection to a file or files.

There is no output displayed for this command.

### Example 2 - Create an ad-hoc protection policy object for multiple users and that has an expiration date
```
PS C:\> $permissions = New-CustomPermissions -Users user1@contoso.com, user2@vanarsdel.com -Permissions Reviewer -ExpirationDate (Get-Date -Month 1 -Day 1 -Year 2020)
```

This command creates an ad-hoc protection policy object that grants users from different organizations usage rights from the Reviewer permissions, and also applies an expiration date. The ad-hoc protection policy object is stored in a variable named permissions, which can then be used to apply this protection to a file or files.

There is no output displayed for this command.
